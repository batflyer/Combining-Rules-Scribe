# Statistical Relational Learning Seminar

Notes taken by Alexander L. Hayes as part of Professor Sriraam Natarajan's spring 2018 seminar on SRL (CS 7301.002). I'm using this opportunity as an excuse to get familiar with GitHub/ShareLaTeX integration.

## Files and Folder Naming Conventions on the Box Page

Papers should be organized and named using a consistent format which features:

* Scribe Name
* Paper Title (abbreviated)
* First Author
* Publication Venue
* Publication Year

For example:

* `Brian_BLOG_Milch_ICML2004.pdf`
* `Hayes_Combining-Rules_Natarajan_AMAI2008.pdf`

Folders should follow a similar format while also including the presentation date.

## Scribe Instructions

Each presentation will have two scribes.

Each scribe is responsible for typesetting a document (LaTeX strongly
preferred in AAAI format or Microsoft Word).

Each scribe can present in the format that they would like to present.
However, the following is a list of suggestions on how to organize this
information.

1.  **Summary** of the work in one paragraph. Think of this as you
    presenting your understanding of the paper. Summarize each section
    in a sentence or two
2.  **Pros and Cons** of the paper in your view.

-   What are the things you like? Domains, experiments, and possibly
    theoretical advances? Place these in the context of the time the
    paper was published.
-   How did it impact the field? What are the big assumptions in the
    paper that you do not agree with? What can be improved in the paper?

3.  **Contributions**: What do you think is the one key contribution of
    this work. Write 4-5 sentences about this key contribution.
4.  **Improvements** which can be made on the paper.

-   How will you change the paper if you were to do it now?

**Scribes are encouraged to read the paper and may talk to one another
about the presentation. But under no circumstances should they look at
the written work of another scribe.**
