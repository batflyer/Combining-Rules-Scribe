\section{Summary}

\section{Pros and Cons}

\section{Contributions}

The authors claim the following contributions: ``(1) A provable linear representation of decomposable combining functions within MLNs; (2) Explicit examples of average-based and noisy combination functions; (3) A formal description of the algorithm for converting from directed models with combining rules to MLNs; (4) A macro-definition that allows for succinct specification of the resulting MLNs; (5) Empirical proof that combining rules can improve the learning of MLNs when the domain knowledge available is minimal."
